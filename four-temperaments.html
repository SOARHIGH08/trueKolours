        Title: Understanding the Four Temperaments: A Comprehensive Overview
        <br><br>
        Introduction
        <br><br>
        Temperament is a fundamental aspect of human personality that has been studied and discussed for centuries. This report aims to provide an organized and comprehensive overview of the four primary temperaments: Sanguine, Choleric, Phlegmatic, and Melancholic. These temperaments, which have been refined and validated over time, play a significant role in shaping individual behavior, emotions, and reactions.

        Temperament theory traces its origins back to Ancient Greece, with Hippocrates proposing the concept of four bodily humors influencing behavior. Galen later developed the current classifications based on this theory. Over time, researchers have recognized the enduring significance of these temperaments across various cultures, ages, and genders.
